## Showcase: Real-World Example

See OpenCMO in action with a **real scan of [Cursor.com](https://cursor.com)** — 176 community discussions discovered across Reddit, Hacker News, Bilibili, Dev.to, and V2EX, with a 177-node knowledge graph.

**[View the Cursor showcase with full data](docs/showcase/cursor/)**

## What Makes OpenCMO Different

- **It treats growth as a system, not a checklist**: SEO, GEO, SERP, community discussion, competitors, reports, and approvals live in one loop.
- **It is built for open-source reality**: before you have a marketing team, you still need discovery, discussion, and credibility.
- **It helps you act on signals**: not just dashboards, but next actions, briefs, drafts, and human-in-the-loop approvals grounded in project context.

## What OpenCMO Helps You Do

- **See where your project is visible**: monitor search rankings, AI-search presence, community mentions, and crawler accessibility.
- **Understand who you are competing with**: map competitors, keyword overlap, and community context in the knowledge graph.
- **Prioritize what to do next**: identify the discussions to join, the keywords to push, and the content gaps worth closing.
- **Keep execution grounded**: generate reports, agent briefs, and approval-ready drafts from the same project context.

## The Growth Loop

1. **Enter your URL** on the homepage — AI scans your brand, category, keywords, and competitive context.
2. **Monitor SEO, GEO, SERP, and community signals** on a Daily / Weekly / Monthly schedule.
3. **Turn raw signals into context** with reports, graph exploration, and AI chat grounded in project data.
4. **Move to execution** with drafts, approvals, and prioritized next actions.

## What Happens When You Hit "Start Monitoring"

One URL triggers a 6-stage AI pipeline that builds a complete growth picture:

| Stage | Name | What it does |
|:-----:|------|-------------|
| 1/6 | **Context Build** | Crawl your URL. Three AI specialists (Product Analyst, SEO Strategist, Community Strategist) run a 3-round debate to extract brand name, category, keywords, and competitors. |
| 2/6 | **Signal Collect** | Run SEO audit, GEO visibility check, community search (Reddit, HN, Dev.to, ...), SERP keyword tracking, and **GitHub potential-user discovery** — all in parallel. |
| 3/6 | **Signal Normalize** | Clean and standardize raw data: deduplicate discussions, normalize scores, align keyword and competitor records. |
| 4/6 | **Domain Review** | Four AI analysts independently review the signals: SEO Analyst, GEO Analyst, Community Analyst, Competitor Analyst. |
| 5/6 | **Strategy Synthesis** | An AI Strategy Director synthesizes all reviews into prioritized findings and actionable recommendations. |
| 6/6 | **Persist & Publish** | Save results to DB, generate strategic report, surface insights on the dashboard. |

> After the initial scan, schedule **daily / weekly / monthly** re-scans to track changes over time.

## Core Capabilities

- **SEO Audit**: Core Web Vitals, `llms.txt`, AI crawler detection, and technical site health.
- **GEO Visibility**: monitor how your brand appears in AI-native search surfaces such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and You.com.
- **SERP Tracking**: track keyword rankings over time with crawl-based or provider-based checks.
- **Community Monitoring**: watch Reddit, Hacker News, Dev.to, YouTube, Bluesky, Twitter/X, plus Chinese platforms such as V2EX, Weibo, Bilibili, and XueQiu.
- **Knowledge Graph**: explore competitors, keywords, and community connections in one visual map.
- **Reports**: generate versioned strategic and weekly reports, with human readouts, agent briefs, PDF export, and email delivery.
- **Potential Users**: automatically discover contactable GitHub developers from your product's keywords, competitors, and related repositories. Score leads by tech-stack match and reachability, then generate personalized outreach (email, Twitter DM, GitHub Issue) through the approval queue.
- **Approvals and AI Chat**: keep humans in the loop while using project-aware AI agents to reason, summarize, and draft.

## Deep Reports

OpenCMO includes a report system inside each project workspace. Open the **Reports** tab or visit `/projects/<id>/reports`.

- **Strategic reports**: full-scan analysis with positioning, competitor context, risks, and recommendations.
- **Weekly reports**: 7-day monitoring summaries with trend changes, risks, wins, and next actions.
- **Dual outputs**: every report is stored as both a **Human Readout** and an **Agent Brief**.
- **Multi-agent pipeline**: human-facing reports use a 6-phase pipeline instead of a single prompt.
- **Graceful fallback**: if the deep pipeline fails, OpenCMO falls back to simpler generation paths so reports stay available.

## Quick Start

OpenCMO works with OpenAI-compatible APIs, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, NVIDIA NIM, Kimi-compatible gateways, and Ollama.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/study8677/OpenCMO.git
cd OpenCMO
pip install -e ".[all]"
crawl4ai-setup

cp .env.example .env
opencmo-web
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

Enter your project URL on the homepage to run the first scan. If no LLM API key is configured yet, a red dot on the Settings icon will guide you to the setup panel.

> Tip: you can also configure API keys from the web dashboard's **Settings** panel without touching `.env`.

<details>
<summary>Frontend development (optional)</summary>

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

The dev app runs at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API traffic to `:8080`.
