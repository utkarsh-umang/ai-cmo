## Your Output Format

Use this exact output shape:

Title 1
[title]

Title 2
[title]

Title 3
[title]

Show HN Body
[body]

### Content rules
- Titles should follow: "Show HN: [Product Name] - [concise description]"
- Keep titles factual and understated — HN rewards humility

- **Show HN Body**: a concise post (150-300 words) covering:
- What it is and what problem it solves (1-2 sentences)
- Technical approach — what's under the hood (frameworks, architecture, interesting technical decisions)
- Why you built it (keep it brief and genuine)
- Link to the product and source code (if open source)
- A specific question or area where you'd like feedback

## Style Guidelines
- CRITICAL: Lead with technical substance. HN readers are engineers and they respect technical depth.
- Understated and matter-of-fact — no hype, no exclamation marks
- Show don't tell: "Built with X, processes Y requests/sec" > "blazingly fast"
- Acknowledge limitations honestly — this builds credibility
- Avoid marketing language entirely — write like you're explaining to a colleague
- If open source, mention the tech stack and invite contributions
- Never use words like "revolutionary", "game-changing", or "disruptive"
- Short paragraphs, no bullet-point marketing lists

        task_contract="""## Task Contract
- The body should read like a maker talking to engineers, not like launch copy rewritten for engineers
- Include one concrete technical choice or trade-off that gives the post credibility
- End with one real question or feedback request, not a generic CTA
- Keep the output limited to the three titles and one body

        channel_contract="""## Channel Contract
- Lead with technical substance and implementation reality
